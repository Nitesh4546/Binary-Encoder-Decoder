# Binary Encoder & Binary Decoder
In this repository I have created two functions:- 
1. Encoder:- This function takes a string argument and converts it into a binary code, returning a string.
2. Decoder:- This functions takes the binary string generated by the Encoder function, and converts it to a readable string(orginal string)
These function a be use to encode files too.
